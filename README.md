# VR Toggle Box

# Summary

The VR Toggle Box provides a VR friendly control surface with simultaneous joystick emulation and a DCS-BIOS interface. The device can be used to control switches and dials on any aircraft in Digital Combat Simulator via joystick controls or DCS-BIOS.

A mode switch to the left of the rotary encoders is selectable between 3 positions. Each position changes the mapping of the switches into different sets of joystick buttons or DCS-BIOS control messages. This provides up to 120 different control inputs. 
 
The project includes:

* STL files for printing the enclosure
* A circuit schematic for wiring the panel
* Code for programming an Arduino Pro Micro
* Customizable LUA scripts for DCS-BIOS to control any aircraft (coming soon)

# Contains 
* 7 - 2 way switches
* 6 - 3 way switches
* 2 - Momentary buttons
* 4 - Rotary encoders with push buttons

# TODO

* Write software (currently using Button Box)
* Software to assign middle position of 3 way switches to joystick buttons
* Software to assign 3 way switch left of rotary switches to change mode of rotaries so they can be mapped to different sets of buttons
